    "As an introduction to state space models, we will start by generating random time series from a state space model.\n",

    "### Random sample generation\n",

    "In order to simulate such a stochastic process in python, we use numpy's [random](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/index.html?highlight=random%20sampling%20numpy%20random#module-numpy.random) submodule, which provides various methods for generating random samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use it we first need to create a Random Number *Generator* (RNG) object. We will do this by writing `rng = `[`np.random.default_rng()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generator.html#numpy.random.default_rng). Note that this method takes a single **optional** parameter, `seed`, which determines the random state. In other words, if we set seed to any integer number and run the code multiple times, the result will always be the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the Generator created and assigned to the variable `rng` we can now use any of its methods, like so: `rng.method_name()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** Create a Random Number Generator object and use it to generate samples drawn from a Gaussian (normal) distribution with the [`.normal`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.Generator.normal.html#numpy.random.Generator.normal) method. Choose any values for the mean, standard deviation and sample size by using the keyword arguments `loc`, `scale`, and `size` appropriately. Assign the output (i.e., the generated samples) to a variable and use numpy's `np.mean` and `np.std` functions to calculate the mean and standard deviation. Observe the difference between the mean and standard deviation of your samples and the values you entered into `.normal`. Quickly describe how the size parameter influences the difference. "

    "## Part 2: Kalman filter and model fitting with maximum likelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "In a realistic scenario, we observe not the state variables but noisy measurements of them. A Kalman filter can help us to estimate the state of a system from measurements (i.e., to \"filter-out\" the measurement noise). \n",
    "\n",
    "A Kalman filter operates by repeating two alternating steps, first it estimates the state of the system at the next time step based on the previous state. It then compares this estimate to the actual measured data, and uses this *a posteriori* knowledge to update its estimate of the system's state. This process is repeated over time, with the Kalman filter continuously updating its estimates with every measurement. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we want to apply a Kalman filter to a data set, we do not have to write everything from scratch. The Python module [`statsmodels`](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) provides a variety of statistical models and other tools for statistical analysis and conveniently includes a [`KalmanFilter`](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.tsa.statespace.kalman_filter.KalmanFilter.html#statsmodels.tsa.statespace.kalman_filter.KalmanFilter) class. This class generally implements a Kalman filter operating on a time series state space model. Another useful class contained in statsmodels is [`MLEModel`](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.tsa.statespace.mlemodel.MLEModel.html), which is based on the `KalmanFilter` class and further allows us to estimate model parameters via Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). \n",
    "\n",
    "Below you can find some code, which adapts the `MLEModel` class for modelling a linear trend, similar to what we saw above. In particular, it defines how the model is structured by telling statsmodels how we want our measurement \"output\" matrix (called \"`design` matrix\" in statsmodels) and the transition matrix to look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, don't worry if you don't fully understand how this code works. The syntax used here, is a bit more complicated as we saw before because it involves the definition of a new class (i.e., `LocalLinearTrend`, our own custom version of statsmodels `MLEModel` so to speak). Some major elements that would need to be changed to adapt to an alternative state space model are indicated in the comments below. "
